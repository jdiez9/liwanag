                <p id="partext">Apart from equal access and economic achievability, SDG7 brings with it a commitment toward environmental sensibility and ecological adaptations toward sustainable technology use. The Philippines, a country rich in natural resources, can benefit much from the use of alternative forms of energy in place of fossil fuels which have been proven to be detrimental to the environment. In 2008, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed into law the Renewable Energy Act (RA 9513), set to accelerate the development of renewable energy sources in the country, those being: solar, wind, ocean, and hybrid systems. In line with this, the Department of Energy (DOE) launched the National Renewale Energy Program (NREP) in 2011. The private sector has also been encouraged by government authorities to invest in the NREP's renewable energy endeavors.</p>

                <div class="arttext">
                    <p>The wind turbines of Ilocos are a primary example of the promising renewable energy scene in the country. The wind farms of Ilocos -- Burgos, Bangui, and Pagudpud -- are connected to the larger Luzon Grid. Thus, the wind farms help stabilize energy supply throughout the whole Luzon region.</p>

                    <p>The Maria Christina Falls of Iligan stands as one of the natural wonders of Mindanao. However, it is not only a sight to see, but also a powerhouse for the whole island. Its water flows into the Agus VI Hydroelectric Plant in the Agus River, powering communities and instrustires in the area. Thus, it can be said that is the heart of hydroelectricity in the region -- one of the first of its kind in the whole archipelago.</p>
