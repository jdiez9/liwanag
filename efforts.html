                <p id="partext">The Philippine government has made continual efforts to push for nationwide electrification, yet until now these efforts have not reached the geographically-isolated parts of the nation. Far-flung rural areas and mountainous regions continue to struggle with limited or unreliable access to electricity. Under the presidency of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in 2004, the National Electrification Administration (NEA) was established. The purpose of this commission was to aid in the electrification of "all barangays." The program during her administration was the Expanded Rural Electrification Program. In 2011, when President Benigno S. Aquino III assumed the presidency, he spearheaded the Sitio Electrification Program, aimed at delivering electricity to all "sitios" of the country. To know the projects of the past two administrations -- those of Duterte and Marcos Jr. -- you may watch the following informative videos.</p>

                <h1>WATCH: PBBM Vows 100% Electrification by 2028</h1>
                <div class="arttext">
                    <p>"Since my assumption into office, almost half a million homes have been given access to electricity. We will spare no effort to achieve full household-electrification by the end of my term. 100%-electrification is within our reach."<br>- President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr. -</p>
                    <p>Since 2022, the administration's Build Better More (BBM) agenda has strengthened the National Electrification Administration (NEA) and has tasked the agency with continuing the projects of previous presidencies such as the Sitio Electrification Program (SEP) and Barangay Line Enhancement Program (BLEP) of President Benigno S. Aquino III.</p>
                    <p>In addition to this, the Marcos administration has allocated a budget of ₱70 billion at the request of the NEA for the efficient functioning of the agency's nationwide electrification efforts. The funds were requested for the purposes of line extension, off-grid systems, and photovaltic mainstreaming. As of writing this article, the agency has not been noted to have been involved in the 2025 budget scandals of the said administration.</p>

                <h1>WATCH: Microgrid Systems Act Signed into Law by PRRD</h1>
                <div class="arttext">
                    <p>"There is a need to utilize rapid advancements in technology such as microgrids, distributed energy resources, and other alternative service providers suitable for unserved and unviable areas."<br>- President Rodrigo R. Duterte -</p>
                    <p>In 2022, President Duterte signed into law a bill to vitalize microgrid development in underserved areas nationwide. This measure aligns with the government's goal to achieve full electrification of the country. This law works in accordance with the Department of Energy (DOE) to use microgrid systems, an alternative form of power supply, to reach those areas without electricity access such as mountainous regions and far-flung communities. As of March 2025, several microgrid systems are already serving households in Palawan, Cebu, Camarines Sur, and Davao Occidental.</p>
