        <p id="partext1">The goal of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 for the UN is to provide the entire globe with equal access to clean and efficient sources of energy. It focuses on being able to equip all people with the power of technology, while being mindful of how such consumption affects the health of the environment. This SDG also takes into account the sociopolitical and geographic factors which contribute to the inequality in technology access and seeks to address it on an international scale. <br><br> While 92% of the world now enjoys access to electricity, many people living in underdeveloped regions are still left behind. Studies have renewable energy is a promising solution to provide energy access to countries without a centralized grid or power source. However, it has been seen that even countries with least electricity access have prioritized investments into coal-fired plants rather than into renewable alternatives.</p>

        <h3 id="headtext2">The Local Situation: What is being done in the Philippines?</h3>
        <p id="partext2">In 2022, the Philippine Congress passed R.A. 11646 or the Microgrid Systems Act, under the administration of President Duterte. This act prioritizes “low-cost, indigenous, renewable, and environment-friendly sources of energy.” The Department of Energy in 2023 vowed to deliver their electrification efforts to the estimated 3.677 million households that still lack electricity access. 1.285 million of these are located in off-grid areas. In addition, 971,000 live in places which are quite far from the reach of Electric Cooperatives [think Davao Light, Meralco]. Thus, the solution proposed by the department is to have these regions served by Private Investor-Owned Utilities [PIOUs]. Tanigichi (2019) also stated that the use of variable renewable energy [VRE] in the electrification of these far-flung areas is not only ideal, but also feasible, following the model of other countries such as Norway.</p>

        <h3 id="headtext3">Where We Come In</h3>
        <p id="partext3">The Luntiang Liwanag advocacy aims to push for the implementation of green energy in the Philippines. We call for the energy authorities in our country, both in the government and private sectors, to consider alternative forms of energy as more efficient and environment-friendly in lighting up the underserved regions of our nation. Our plan of action is to spread awareness of the benefits of these alternative forms of energy, through the lens of the UN's SDG7. We conform our advocacy to the three sub-points of the said goal: Ekwalidad (Equal Access for All), Ekolohiya (Renewable Energy), and Ekonomiya (Energy Efficiency).</p>
